### About this project:

You can read [my thesis](http://www.biblioteca.pucminas.br/teses/Informatica_MateusToledoDaSilveiraLeao_30770_TextoCompleto.pdf) where I explore deeply how this model works and how I applied it. My thesis was written in portuguese but you can check my published paper in english [here](https://www.worldwidejournals.com/paripex/article/a-multicriteria-decision-making-in-conditions-of-uncertainty-for-the-ports-ore-exportation/NDA4ODQ=/).
