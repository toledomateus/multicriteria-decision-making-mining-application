Welcome to my repo about Decision Making Under Conditions of Uncertainty, using multicriteria <X,F> models to plan export ore production in a company with multiple ports.

To go further on this topic, I strongly recommend the following materials:

### About this project:

You can read [my thesis](http://www.biblioteca.pucminas.br/teses/Informatica_MateusToledoDaSilveiraLeao_30770_TextoCompleto.pdf) where I explore deeply how this model works and how I applied it. My thesis was written in Portuguese but you can check my published paper in English [here](https://www.worldwidejournals.com/paripex/article/a-multicriteria-decision-making-in-conditions-of-uncertainty-for-the-ports-ore-exportation/NDA4ODQ=/).

### About the topic:

If you want to go deep into all the mathematics theories applied behind these models, you can check more details in this [book](https://www.wiley.com/en-ie/Multicriteria+Decision-Making+Under+Conditions+of+Uncertainty%3A+A+Fuzzy+Set+Perspective-p-9781119534921).
